## Goal
* From a list of 200 website domains, we want to extract the relevant URL of that website, we will be using the sitemap of each website to get the pages. 
* Then, we will be scrapping each of these URLs in order to find which of them has SD in them. The goal here is to return a percentage of coverage of SD for this list of domains. We will store this percentage on a html page called index
* Then, for each of these URLs, we will look at which types of SD are in there. 

## To Do
* Store domains
* get all URLs from these domains by sraping the sitemap
* pass these URLs to another formula that looks for structured data
